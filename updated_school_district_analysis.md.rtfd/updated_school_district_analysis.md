\f0\fs26 \cf0 Overview of School District Analysis\
	The overview and purpose of this lesson is to assist Maria in determining if academic dishonesty is evident in the school district of 15, specifically Thomas High School and it\'92s freshman class.  The school board has come to Maria for help in determining if there is anything shady going on at Thomas High School, and if there is a noticeable difference in the overall district\'92s scores when excluding the 9th grade class of Thomas High.  The goal is to provide Maria insight on this potential, issue, utilizing real test score data and running a variety analytic tools.\

\f0 	}The effect on the district summary is negligible, as pulling out the 9th grade test scores for one of fifteen schools was not enough to sway the data of the entire district \

\f0 	}The effect on the school summary was also negligible.  The 9th grade math and reading scores were never above a whole point difference when compared to the other average scores of the 3 higher grades.  The differences were very marginal with the 9th grade average not seeming like an outlier at all.  The only main affect of replacing the data with NaNs was to reduce the population/sample size of 9th grade students in the district.\

\f0 	}As previously touched on above, the \expnd0\expndtw0\kerning0
math and reading scores by grade didn\'92t seem to provide much to make inferences upon.  Also, it should be understood that higher level math courses contain higher level material, therefore one should keep in mind that the average scores from grade to grade should a little different.\

\f0 	}The majority of cases show the \expnd0\expndtw0\kerning0
scores by school spending were inversely affected.  As shown by the tables on the attached picture. the top 5 schools all had lower budgets per student than the bottom 5 schools.\

Scores by school type and school size seemed to be a major factor in the average test scores from the students.  This is likely due to factors that we cannot easily test, such as parenting, home life, and quality of teachers, but we may infer that in general, charter schools tend to produce better scores than district schools.\
\ls3\ilvl1\kerning1\expnd0\expndtw0 {\listtext

\f0 	}Dropping the Thomas High school 9th grade scores only marginally increased the average reading scores and marginally decreased the average math scores of Thomas High School.  \
{\listtext	
\f1 \uc0\u9702 
\f0 	}Since both of the average scores of Thomas High School calculated are higher than the average taken of the other 14 schools, this will resulted in a slightly higher average, the district average as a whole will benefit from having Thomas High School in the data sample.  However, removing 9th grade students @ Thomas High School will only have the very marginal effects as described above (slight increase of average reading score / slight decrease of average math score).  It was not a large amount impact for Thomas High to replace any other schools in the Top 5 / Bottom 5 Schools.\
